## 2024
This year was created using [Bun](https://bun.sh) via `bun init` in bun v1.1.29. Bun is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.  

### To install dependencies:
```bash
bun install
```

### To run:
```bash
bun run 2024/day/[DAY]/index.ts
```
Each `index.ts` contains the implementation for Part 1 and Part 2; Runing `index.ts` will solve both parts.
